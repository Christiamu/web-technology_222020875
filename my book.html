<p>Admin table database structure This is table is table that will be only created by admin and will hold other system users apart from admin  will give them email and password that they will use to login and access the project or system, and also t used to register if she/he’s don’t have an account so once you must to create account in order to login and access or use the system.
            Note: the created Admin will not have same ability and right in the system.</p></br>

  <li><b>coffevarities table</b></li>

			<p>This is coffevarities   table in the coffee cultivation farming and it will be created by the admin, and it will be accessed by the user who is already in the database .</p> </br>
  
			<li><b>Farmers table </b></li>

			<p>Farmers table  database structure This table Stores details or information about the suppliers providing the products, including Variety(int) primary key  , name, contact information, etc. This table helps in managing relationships with Variety Name ,Description  and tracking performance.</p></br>

			<li><b>Farms table</b></li>

			<p>Farms table in the database:
In order to make great farming you need to have the place where you can cultivate the crops.That’s why  I created farms table .</p></br>

<li><b>Harvest table</b></li>
<p>Harvest table in the database:
After knowing what kind of the seeds, we need to grow and knowing the place, which is more favorite depending on the soil, depending also chemical fertilizers, depending on the professions' farmers that we have hired . of that we must harvest our huge harvests
 
Harvest will show us what we worked for either we decide to increase our crops or to decrease it and also our harvest will decide whether we can close our business and also it will help us where we can put more effort so that next time or next season will be successful for us.</p></br>
 
<li><b>Sales table</b></li> </ol>

 <p>After all  of that what we need is to find the market that we can sells our product
We have to find a good market so that we get more profit 
This is where we will find money of the investment of the next season and the 
Amount to pay our employees and the paying the assurance of the company and 
Even to have some amount of savings.</p></br>

			    <p><li style="display: inline; background-color:pink; margin-right: 10px"> INTRODUCTION</li></p>
<ol><li><b>JAVA PROGRAMMING</b></li>
<p>Java is a widely used, high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, reliability, and versatility. Here's a detailed description:</p>
 
<p>Object-Oriented: Java is fundamentally object-oriented, meaning it revolves around the concept of classes and objects. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, promoting modular, reusable, and maintainable code.</p>
 
<p>Platform-Independent: One of Java's most significant features is its platform independence. Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This "write once, run anywhere" capability makes Java highly portable across different operating systems and hardware architectures.</p>
 
<p>Robust and Secure: Java is designed with a strong emphasis on reliability and security. It incorporates features like automatic memory management through garbage collection, exception handling, and strict type checking to ensure robustness. Additionally, Java's bytecode verification process enhances security by preventing unauthorized code execution.</p>
 
<p>Multi-threaded: Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program. This feature facilitates the development of responsive and scalable applications, making Java suitable for building server-side applications, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and multimedia applications.</p>
 
<p>Rich Standard Library: Java comes with an extensive standard library (Java API) that provides ready-to-use classes and methods for various tasks. The Java API covers areas such as input/output (I/O), networking, database connectivity, graphical user interface (GUI) development, and more. This rich set of libraries simplifies development and accelerates the creation of Java applications.</p>
 
<p>Community Support and Ecosystem: Java benefits from a large and active community of developers, enthusiasts, and organizations. This vibrant ecosystem contributes to the continuous evolution of the language through updates, frameworks, libraries, and tools. Java's popularity and widespread adoption ensure ample resources, documentation, and support available for developers.</p>
 
<p>Used Across Diverse Applications: Java finds applications in a wide range of domains, including web development, enterprise software, mobile app development (Android), scientific computing, financial services, and more. Its versatility and scalability make it a popular choice for building large-scale, mission-critical systems.</p>
 
<li><b>	The Java programming environment consists of several components:</b></li>

<p>Java Development Kit (JDK): Provides tools for developing Java applications, including the Java compiler (javac), the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and various utilities.</p>

<p>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software tools that facilitate Java development by providing features such as code editing, debugging, and project management. Popular Java IDEs include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans.</p>
<p>Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Includes the JVM and libraries necessary for running Java applications. It allows users to execute Java programs without needing the development tools provided by the JDK.</p>

<p>Java Application Programming Interface (API): A collection of pre-written Java classes and interfaces organized into packages. The Java API provides a vast array of functionality for tasks such as input/output operations, networking, GUI development, and more.</p>
 
<p>JDBC, which stands for Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases. It provides a standard interface for connecting to relational databases and executing SQL queries. JDBC enables Java applications to perform database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data.</p>
   <h2><bold><li>The steps involved in establishing connectivity using JDBC typically include:</li></bold></h2>
 
   <li><b> Import JDBC Packages:</b></li>
      <p>Import the necessary JDBC packages in your Java program. These packages include `java.sql` and specific database driver packages.</p>
 
   <li><b> Load and Register the JDBC Driver:
      <p>Use `Class.forName( )` to dynamically load and register the JDBC driver for the specific database you're connecting to. This step is necessary to inform the DriverManager about the database driver.</p>
 
   ``<P>`java
      Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");</p>
   ```
 
   <li><b> Create a Connection:</b></li>
      <p>Use the `DriverManager.getConnection( )` method to establish a connection to the database. You need to provide the URL of the database, username, and password.</p>
 
   ``<P>`java
   Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database", "username", "password");</p>
   ```
 
   <li><b>Create a Statement:</b></li>
      <p>Create a Statement or PreparedStatement object to execute SQL queries. Statements are used for executing static SQL queries, while PreparedStatements are preferred for parameterized queries.</p>
 
   ``<p>`java
   Statement statement = connection.createStatement();</p>
   ```
 
   <li><b> Execute SQL Queries:</b></li>
      <P>Use the Statement or PreparedStatement objects to execute SQL queries and receive results.</P>
 
   <p>java
   ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM your_table");</p>
   ```
 
   <li><b> Process Results:</b></li>
     <p> Process the results obtained from the executed queries.</p>
 
   <li><b> Close Resources:</b></li></ol>
      <p>Close the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects to release resources and avoid memory leaks.</p>
 
   <p>`java
   resultSet.close();
   statement.close();
   connection.close();</p>
